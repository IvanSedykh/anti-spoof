https://wandb.ai/idsedykh/asr_project/runs/w885pkin?workspace=user-idsedykh

## Installation guide

1. install conda, create new env
2. install torch
   ``` shell
   conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
   ```
3. install other stuff

   ```shell
   pip install -r ./requirements.txt
   ```
4. pray and hope

## Recommended implementation order

You might be a little intimidated by the number of folders and classes. Try to follow this steps to gradually undestand
the workflow.

1) Test `hw_asr/tests/test_dataset.py`  and `hw_asr/tests/test_config.py` and make sure everythin works for you
2) Implement missing functions to fix tests in  `hw_asr\tests\test_text_encoder.py`
3) Implement missing functions to fix tests in  `hw_asr\tests\test_dataloader.py`
4) Implement functions in `hw_asr\metric\utils.py`
5) Implement missing function to run `train.py` with a baseline model
6) Write your own model and try to overfit it on a single batch
7) Implement ctc beam search and add metrics to calculate WER and CER over hypothesis obtained from beam search.
8) ~~Pain and suffering~~ Implement your own models and train them. You've mastered this template when you can tune your
   experimental setup just by tuning `configs.json` file and running `train.py`
9) Don't forget to write a report about your work
10) Get hired by Google the next day

## Before submitting

0) Make sure your projects run on a new machine after complemeting the installation guide or by 
   running it in docker container.
1) Search project for `# TODO: your code here` and implement missing functionality
2) Make sure all tests work without errors
   ```shell
   python -m unittest discover hw_asr/tests
   ```

   *TODO: check test.py, prepare report*
3) Make sure `test.py` works fine and works as expected. You should create files `default_test_config.json` and your
   installation guide should download your model checpoint and configs in `default_test_model/checkpoint.pth`
   and `default_test_model/config.json`.
   ```shell
   python test.py \
      -c default_test_config.json \
      -r default_test_model/checkpoint.pth \
      -t test_data \
      -o test_result.json
   ```
4) Use `train.py` for training
